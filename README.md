Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Coupled Fluid-Thermal Systems

Welcome to PINNverse â€” a modular, benchmark-driven repository for solving and validating complex differential systems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This project explores the intersection of deep learning and scientific computing, with a focus on boundary layer flows, heat transfer, and nonlinear coupled ODEs.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

PINNverse provides a reproducible framework for:

* Solving high-order nonlinear differential equations using PINNs
* Validating PINN predictions against analytic or semi-analytic solutions
* Benchmarking fluid and thermal profiles under varying physical parameters
* Visualizing residuals, boundary condition adherence, and convergence metrics

Whether you're modeling viscoelastic flows, thermal gradients, or multi-physics systems, PINNverse offers a flexible starting point.

## ðŸ”§ Features

* âœ… TensorFlow-based PINN architecture with automatic differentiation
* âœ… Support for fourth-order and coupled second-order systems
* âœ… Boundary condition enforcement and supervised data integration
* âœ… RMSE and RÂ² metrics for model evaluation
* âœ… Clean visualization of velocity and temperature profiles
* âœ… Easily extendable for parametric sweeps and PINN ensembles



## ðŸ“Š Example Applications

* Generalized Falknerâ€“Skan boundary layer flow
* Heat transfer with internal source/sink terms
* PINN validation against analytic temperature profiles
* Residual-based diagnostics for physical consistency
